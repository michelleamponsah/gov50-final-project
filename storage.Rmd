This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Answer 1

loading the data
There are 7,014 candidates in the dataset. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

fb_ads <- read_csv("data/fb_ads.csv")

fb_ads
```

##knitr::kable()
```{r}
incumbency_table <- fb_ads |> 
  group_by(incumbency) |> 
  summarize(count = n()) 
knitr::kable(incumbency_table)
```


## Answer 2

##Open seat republicans had the highest rate of promoting FB ads at 85.6%. 
```{r}
party_incumbent_promote <- fb_ads |> 
  filter(office %in% c("US House", "US Senate")) |>
  group_by(party, incumbency) |> 
  summarize(promote_prop = mean(ad_tone_promote, na.rm = TRUE)
knitr::kable(party_incumbent_promote,
digits = 3, 
col.names = c("Party", "Incumbency", "Promote_Prop"))
party_incumbent_promote
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
impressions_millions <- fb_ads |> 
  filter(office == "US House") |> 
  mutate(impressions_millions = impressions/1000000) 
plot_q3 <- ggplot(data = impressions_millions, mapping = aes(x = impressions_millions)) + 
  geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Facebook Impressions for US House Races",
                          x = "Impressions in Millions", y = "Count")
plot_q3
```


## Answer 4


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
fb_House <- fb_ads |>  
  filter(office == "US House")
fb_House <- fb_House |> 
  slice_max(impressions_millions, n = 15) |> 
  mutate(can_name_last = fct_reorder(cand_name_last, impressions_millions))
fb_House
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

fb_top_plot <- ggplot(data = fb_House, mapping = aes(x = impressions_millions, y = fct_reorder(cand_name_last, impressions_millions)) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(fill = party) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("R" = "red", "D" = "blue")) +
  labs(title = Top 15 Candidates by Ad Impressions in Millions, x = "Candidate Name",
  y = "Impressions in Millions")

fb_top_plot
